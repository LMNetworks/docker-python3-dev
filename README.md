# docker-python3-dev

Python3 image based on [`lmnetworks/python3`](https://hub.docker.com/r/lmnetworks/python3) with development tools.

Currently the only tool included is [PyLint](https://www.pylint.org).

This image is meant to be used as a base to manually test stuff during development or as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
